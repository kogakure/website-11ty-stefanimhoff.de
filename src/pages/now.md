# Now

I live in **Hamburg**, Germany and work (from home) as a **Senior Software Engineer** on the **Design System** of [XING](https://www.xing.com/).

I wake up each morning without an alarm clock between **6:30** and **7:00**, and go to bed at **22:00**. I meditate 15-20 minutes every morning, learn **Japanese** and **Spanish** every day on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/kogakure), and do [Calisthenics](/calisthenics) and running 2-3 times a week.

I’m reading currently these **books**:

{% bookshelf %}
{% book "B08VF32DXK" %}
{% book "B016AWGJBK" %}
{% book "0812968255" %}
{% endbookshelf %}

I’m working with the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) note-taking method using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write and link ideas, [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) to store reference material, and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) to create texts out of the ideas. These are some statistics:

- **2125** notes
- **319** bibliography entries
- **5031** reference items
