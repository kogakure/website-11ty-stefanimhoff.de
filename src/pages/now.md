# Now

I live in **Hamburg**, Germany and work (from home) as a **Senior Software Engineer** on the **Design System** of [XING](https://www.xing.com/).

Each morning I wake up without an alarm clock at around **7:00**, and go to bed at **22:00**. I meditate 15-20 minutes every morning, learn **Japanese**, **Korean**, and **Spanish** every day on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/kogakure), and do [Calisthenics](/calisthenics/) 2-3 times a week.

### AI Art

Recently, I started creating AI Art with [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and post my works on my [Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/kogakure.ai.art/).

### Reading

I’m reading now these **books**:

{% bookshelf %}
{% book "0452011876" %}
{% book "046501948X" %}
{% book "3741629472" %}
{% endbookshelf %}

### Note-Taking

I’m working with the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) note-taking method using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write and link ideas, [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) to store reference material, and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) to create texts out of the ideas. These are some statistics:

- **3430** notes
- **624** bibliography entries
- **5867** reference items
