## TV Shows

- [Mad Men](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1104-mad-men) {% netflix "70136135" %} – I started rewatching this fantastic TV show. It won 5 Golden Globes and 132 other awards. Its story spans over multiple years and is so deep and stacked with so many layers of interpretation.

## Movies

- [Annihilation](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/300668-annihilation) {% netflix "80206300" %} – I rewatched the Netflix movie because after reading Lovecraft’s _The Colour out of Space_, I realized that the writers have written in parts—without intention—a nice adaptation of the story.

- [Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/624932-dave-chappelle-sticks-stones) {% netflix "81140577" %} – Very funny, political incorrect, and right to the heart of every virtue signaller and social justice warrior.

## Music

- [The Arrow of Time Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ipnQkuUk9J8tUfuXxzutK) – Music from _Time-lapse of the Future_. Especially [Sun Mother](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zfZ27Aukg5hUlhsd0gOnC) I hear quite often.
- [Deichkind: Keine Party](https://open.spotify.com/album/6jVmvHcCU4RpUI8Gsfhw7X) – I enjoyed the new song from the Hamburg Hip-Hop Band Deichkind. The [music video](https://youtu.be/vH1poPSIvOk) is really funny. This dance move will prevail.
