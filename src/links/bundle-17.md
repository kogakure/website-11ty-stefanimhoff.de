## TV Shows & Movies

- [Undone](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/86340-undone) {% primevideo "0JGKX50M4GZ01A5P9Y70DTNBIG" %} ‚ùß This TV Show is incredible. It‚Äôs done with Rotoscoping technique and the backgrounds are painted in oil paint. I saw two interviews with the director Hisko Hulsing that show how it‚Äôs made: [Director Hisko Hulsing Explains How it's Made](https://youtu.be/J9sYE9tIwTE) and [How Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúUndone‚Äù Animates Dreams With Rotoscoping And Oil Paints](https://youtu.be/kE_aPLo2nCg).
- [Final Space](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/74387-final-space) {% netflix "80174479" %} ‚ùß I‚Äôm sad, the show didn‚Äôt get another season. It‚Äôs a dark Sci-Fi TV Show with an exciting story and deep characters.
- [Better Call Saul](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/60059-better-call-saul) {% netflix "80021955" %} ‚ùß The last season of this highly-rated TV Show started with weekly episodes. I‚Äôm curious how they‚Äôll connect the ending to [Breaking Bad](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1396-breaking-bad).
- [The Leftovers](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/54344-the-leftovers) {% primevideo "0R9T1ZDK4R4J5L2RX7U1G6H6VI" %} ‚ùß I found this TV Show (2014-2017) by accident. The story starts with 2% of the world‚Äôs population suddenly disappearing and nobody knows why. It‚Äôs an interesting story about how people deal with loss in different ways.

## Podcasts

- [The Destroyer of Worlds ‚Äî Dan Carlin‚Äôs Hardcore History](https://overcast.fm/+BDAZUfg) ‚ùß This short 5-hour-long ‚ÄúBlitz‚Äù episode about the history of the nuclear bomb is incredible. There is no better history podcast than [Dan Carlin‚Äôs Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/).
- [The Joe Rogan Experience: Gad Saad](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6rDI1etn04E0qJM0qfG3p5)
- [The White Vault](https://thewhitevault.com/) ‚ùß This audio drama is fantastic! I finished the first two seasons taking place in Svalbard and just started listening to the third season taking place in South America.

## Cool & Interesting

- [Symphony in Acid](https://symphonyinacid.net/) is a stunning visual-art and music project by [Max Cooper](https://maxcooper.net/) from his new album [Unspoken Words](https://unspokenwords.net/). It was created by the polish graphic designer, animator, and programmer [Ksawery Komputery](https://ksawerykomputery.pl/). You can watch it as a video on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/708803521) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_n_iKR3Icio), but I recommend using it in the browser because the project reacts to inputs by mouse and keyboard. (via [Bram.us](https://www.bram.us/2022/05/20/max-cooper-symphony-in-acid/))
- I found the Mac OS application [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), a free and extendable launcher. It has an [app store](https://www.raycast.com/store) (40+ pages) to extend the basic functionality, supports Clipboard History, Snippets, [Script commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands), and allows for developers to [create apps for Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/developers) with React.
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) ‚ùß I‚Äôm a big fan of RSS as a technology to stay up to date. Rather than surfing in algorithmically sorted lists inside apps, I want to read everything I subscribe to (Blogs, News sites, Video sites, Twitter, Reddit, Newsletters) inside one app. I‚Äôve used Feedly for many years, but their price is expensive and they recently introduced limits for Twitter which made me look for another feed service. Feedbin is just fantastic! It supports everything I need for a fair price. It has a fantastic feature that shows you when somebody makes changes later to the content. I use the ‚Äústar‚Äù feature to automatically move items with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/).
- [Reeder 5](https://reeder.app/) is a beautiful Feed Reader for Mac OS and iOS. It can be used with lots of third-party services like Feedbin or Feedly, but used without any (using iCloud to sync your subscriptions between devices). It has many useful features, like Reader View, to read articles if the feed is only an excerpt, or [Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/).

- [Why the Lack of Religion Breeds Mental Illness](https://youtu.be/DffqK6j-y1U) ([Transcript](https://academyofideas.com/2022/05/why-the-lack-of-religion-breeds-mental-illness/)) ‚ùß A video essay about the crisis of meaning, what Carl Jung called <q>the general neurosis of our times.</q>
- I discovered the YouTube channel of [Daniel LaBelle](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanielLaBelle/).
