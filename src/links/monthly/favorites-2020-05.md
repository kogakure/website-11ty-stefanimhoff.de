## Videos

- **Joe Rogan** did a [second interview with Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/RcYjXbSJBN8) which was very interesting to watch. Also, he announced a 100 Million Dollar USD deal with Spotify. His show will move to Spotify on September 1st, being exclusively available later this year (still as a free Podcast).
- One of my favorite channels, **What I’ve Learned**, created the video [Why are you Uncertain, Unfocused, and Anxious? What should we do about it?](https://youtu.be/GaJmw54BMcw). It’s of unbelievable high quality, scientifically researched as usual, with a lot of self-shot content, and also makes uses the new YouTube section feature, to name sections of the video.
- I finished one of the best lectures on Personality by **Jordan B Peterson**: [2017 Personality and Its Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi), filmed at the University of Toronto. The ~30 hours of lectures are extremely interesting. The last nine lectures dedicate the topic of the Big 5 personality traits and their implications for life.

The history of forbidden coins in [Why This Coin is Illegal to Own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegtWw4WRLY). [The \$22 Million Most Expensive Party Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxQ19dzi4YQ) is the story of the party which destroyed (probably) the empire of the last Iranian Shah. And [The Island That Keeps Appearing and Disappearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFeESzANUXE) explains the story behind a Mediterranean island that appears and disappears.

- **Thomas Frank** shows [Roam Research](https://youtu.be/vxOffM_tVHI), a new note-taking tool on the block. It looks promising, but as I explained in my last article, [Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method With DEVONthink](https://www.stefanimhoff.de/zettelkasten-note-taking-devonthink/), it’s not for me. He also made a video about [3 habits for better work-life balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctdUGVmEvfo) and explains [how he takes notes from books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATDCsY-VJPA) which had good tips I’ll take over.

- The channel **The Beauty Of** created another beautiful collage of the film [The Handmaiden (Ah-ga-ssi)](https://youtu.be/qeK8KoAA31Y). Now I need to see the movie. It’s not the first time I tried a film or game after watching one of these beautiful pieces of art.

Finally, they explore in [Hey Fallon, You’re Doing it Wrong!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Omnex5tyfk) how good of a job the late show hosts are doing during the pandemic, how good their performance as YouTubers is and what this might mean for the future.

- This was a good month for everybody interested in history. **Voices of the Past** released two interesting videos: Reading of the Florentine Codex showing [the perspective on the conquest of Mexico by an Aztec](https://youtu.be/FAp30mf1pYY). It was fascinating listening to the story of the conquest from another perspective, including the story of [La Noche Triste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Noche_Triste). In another video, they [read a letter from Will Adams, the Englishman who became a Samurai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nw6jiX2p7k), describing his life in the service of the shogun. His story inspired the novel [Shōgun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402093.Sh_gun) by James Clavell.

- By accident, I discovered the [FMF 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq_blACKj_-xhsZP9VqzjHRNwaovQcNs4), a Video Games Music Gala in Krakóv, while searching for the game [Journey](https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/). I found the incredible good interpretation of the song [Apotheosis from Journey](https://youtu.be/XpT-92HS11I) 🤩, played by **Tina Guo** and the Beethoven Academy Orchestra. This is the best performance I’ve ever seen of this song! There were a lot more known songs from games played at this concert.
- **Tina Guo**, an unbelievable talented Chinese-American cellist, has a lot of fantastic performances on her [own channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcSl2KAMdMEFoKZhHpwH8g). I liked, in particular, her performance of another beautiful song: [Oogway Ascends](https://youtu.be/j_6LC0HFims), a song from Kung Fu Panda and also [her “practice” of a cover of Lindsey Stirling’s Crystallize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEmXMYBP6c).

## TV Shows

- [Beastars](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/90937-beastars) {% flag "1" %} {% netflix "81054847" %} – This is a really good Japanese animation TV show about a world where herbivores and carnivores coexist with each other. The main characters are a wolf and a rabbit.
- [Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/100698-tiger-king-murder-mayhem-and-madness) {% flag "1" %} {% netflix "81115994" %} – After this show was recommended by multiple people on multiple occasions I started watching it. And it’s that good. Crazy, bizarre, but good.
- [Community](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/18347-community), {% flag "4" %} {% flag "5" %} {% flag "6" %} {% netflix "70155589" %} – I finished watching this show a second time and it was not one bit less funny than the first time. I think it might be the funniest TV show ever produced.
- [The Hollow](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79948-the-hollow) {% flag "2" %} {% netflix "80147919" %} – I didn’t think this show would have a second season. Not because it’s not good—quite the opposite—but the story looked like a concluded story arc. But the managed to deliver another fantastic season.
- [Scissor Seven](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79141) {% flag "2" %} {% netflix "81156880" %} – This extremely funny, animated, Chinese TV show about a quite unsuccessful assassin and barber with memory loss is one of my highlights of this year. The animation style is fabulous. It changes during an episode all the time. Sometimes characters look cute, then ugly, or powerful, while always keeping the characteristics of a character. Some people probably don’t even notice the change of style.
- [Final Space](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/74387-final-space) {% flag "2" %} {% netflix "80174479" %} – Don’t be fooled by the cute animation style. This space saga is dark. You can get scared of the space watching it.
- [After Life](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79410-after-life) {% flag "2" %} {% netflix "80998491" %} – **Ricky Gervais** is really a master combining comedy and tragedy in this TV show filled with whimsical characters.
- [Abstract: The Art of Design](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/70177-abstract-the-art-of-design) {% flag "2" %} {% netflix "80057883" %} – I finally finished this fantastic TV show. I tried to not do it because now I probably have to wait another two years for the next season. At least the last episode ended strong with **Jonathan Hoefler**. It’s the best documentaries about Designers I’ve ever seen.
- [Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83519-patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj) {% flag "6" %} {% netflix "80239931" %}
- [La Casa de Papel](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel) {% flag "2" %} {% netflix "80192098" %} – Damn, I seldom had some much fun watching a money heist TV show. And it’s also good to learn some Spanish.
- [Suits](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/37680-suits) {% flag "7" %} {% netflix "70195800" %} – It’s always entertaining to watch this TV show, even though I usually don’t understand the legal stunts the characters perform. 😬 Sad they had to remove two characters from the show because of Meghan Markle marrying into the Royals.

## Movies

- [Extraction](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/545609-extraction) {% netflix "80230399" %} – Don’t expect too much story, but it’s a quite nice Action and was fun to watch.
- [Rams](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/510243-rams) – A nice documentary by **Gary Hustwit** about the famous industrial designer Dieter Rams. Hustwit made the movie this month a few days for free.

- [indubio](https://open.spotify.com/show/69FTLjcQWoXqhtg1hoy12V?si=GeEYg5esSJGmZ7c0TEti5w) 🇩🇪 – I found this new German political podcast by **Die Achse des Guten** (_The Axis of Good_) which has really good and broad discussions about current politics. It encourages your thinking by touching controversial topics. One episode talked about the topic of obedience of people to orders of the government regarding COVID-19, [Die Obrigkeit droht uns](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HB2rSFwjQaB3PCQ60aidL?si=1kqXaSx6SqWzVP1DbMAmlQ). Another one had an interesting interview with a lawyer who just won a lawsuit against a censorship agency of Facebook labeling opinions as “false” in [Zensoren haben verloren](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Xsf0RkYktqPp7kqvpLEUG?si=zhYpAQGdS5G7ojCJvOEkXg).

It’s so funny that I’ll probably start to listen regularly to this Podcast.

## Books

I didn’t make a lot of progress in my current books this month, because I used the time to transfer my previous read books into my new **Zettelkasten** system and properly digest the books before continuing reading new books.

- [Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus) ({% affiliate "Amazon", "1784703931" %})
- [The Divine Comedy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6656.The_Divine_Comedy) ({% affiliate "Amazon", "0679433139" %})

{% book "0679433139" %}
{% book "0735211736" %}
{% endbookshelf %}

- I read quite a lot of articles about the **Zettelkasten** method as a note-taking system. The website of the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) has a nice overview of a lot of articles. I particularly liked two articles: [Zettelkasten — How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) by **David B. Clear** and [Living with a Zettelkasten](https://omxi.se/2015-06-21-living-with-a-zettelkasten.html) by **Magnus Eriksson**. I even wrote my <TextLink to="/zettelkasten-note-taking-devonthink/">own article</TextLink> on how I implemented the method in my daily workflow with DEVONthink.

- [COVID-19 and the Normalization of Mass Surveillance](https://quillette.com/2020/05/11/covid-19-and-the-normalization-of-mass-surveillance/) – Something to think about. An event that frightens a lot of people is a slippery-slope into Totalitarianism. The War on Terror already brought us secret torture camps, overruled due process, mass surveillance, and Drone war. We need to be vigilant the State doesn’t use the Pandemic to try to cut rights.

RSS is still my favorite technology to consume information. Here is my [RSS feed](https://www.stefanimhoff.de/index.xml).
