## Stuff & Things

- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/) – I switched from _Spotify_ to _Apple Music_ this month. Spotify censored and de-platformed a small German podcast I’m listening to out of ideological reasons (they dared to interview an author who wrote a book about gender-transition in children). As Apple Music has 10 Million more songs, lyrics, a nicer app, and the same price, the decision to switch was not hard for me. But the migration of my playlists was stressful because I needed to speed up, as Spotify closed the APIs this month. I got out before the lock-in.
- [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/) – My new default Podcast app. I ask myself why I never considered using it before. It syncs across my devices, looks nice, and doesn’t censor content.
- [Browser Threat Test](https://brax.me/geo/) – Test your browser for the vulnerability of Fingerprinting and other things.

- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) – A fantastic website with scientific data and over 3000 charts on hundreds of topics.
- [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/app/drafts/id1236254471) – A nice app I started using for quickly adding text on the go (via Apple Watch or iPhone) and later convert it to a permanent note in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- [New Discourses](https://newdiscourses.com/) – Pursuing the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. I discovered this fantastic website, founded by _James Lindsay_.
