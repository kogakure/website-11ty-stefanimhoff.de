## Podcasts

### Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History

I started listening to this podcast because it was repeatedly recommended on _The Joe Rogan Experience_, _Elon Musk_ and other people. This month I listened to nearly 14 hours on the history of the Persian Empire and its clash with Greek civilization. Incredibly good! _Dan Carlin_ produces 2-3 podcasts per year.

## Articles

- [Bill Gates and Neo-Feudalism: A Closer Look at Farmer Bill](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/bill-gates-neo-feudalism-farmer-bill/) – This 45-minute long article by _Robert F. Kennedy, Jr._ shines a light on all the evil things _Bill Gates_ did in the last 20 years in the name of Philanthropy. It’s shocking how vile he is, I’m convinced he should be put to trial in Den Haag for _Crimes Against Humanity_. But his plans for the future of the Earth are even more dystopian than writers of _Black Mirror_ could ever imagine.

## People

### Tom MacDonald

I discovered this brilliant Rapper because his new song [Fake Woke](https://youtu.be/2l6JUNFAJ9o) landed on the top of the US charts. He is an independent artist and his girlfriend creates his awesome music videos.

He went viral in 2017 after criticizing the Rap culture with his song [Dear Rappers](https://youtu.be/aGip64cYJTg). In 2020 he wrote [Blame The Rappers](https://youtu.be/30CDHuiRCrc) that addresses the toxic influence of Rap culture on children.

In songs as [Whiteboy](https://youtu.be/oxJtX081jj4), [No Lives Matter](https://youtu.be/t86ClLM3ZGY), [People So Stupid](https://youtu.be/I6FmwBPDT-w), or [Buttholes](https://youtu.be/83Ntpeih4f4) he criticizes social issues in the US for example racism, identity politics, or cancel culture.

In [Best Rapper Ever](https://youtu.be/9y4IAdZ8srA) he deals with his shadow, anxiety, alcoholism, and self-doubt. His beautiful song [Angels](https://youtu.be/dFlspSoW430) deals with addiction and suicide.

He has a strong connection to his fans and haters. [My Fans](https://youtu.be/LnlJQ7nJp_E) is a heart-warming homage to his fans. His song [I Wish](https://youtu.be/8wNUjCcaGrM) used [send-in video wishes](https://youtu.be/8WdTn0vly54).

Due to his honest rap songs, he has to deal with a lot of online hate. He mocks these attacks in his funny songs [Everybody Hates Me](https://youtu.be/Vny0W0axomc) or [Fake Fans](https://youtu.be/gT5DpOiQ_WA).

After the rapper _Mac Lethal_ insulted _Tom MacDonald_ on Twitter (Tweet now deleted), Tom responded just two days later with a brilliant diss in [Lethal Injection](https://youtu.be/FdXGEKHitwg). Mac Lethal answered with a rap in [Single White Female](https://youtu.be/xCEkwCJp5ns) and was burned with another professional produced rap diss and music video _one day later_ in [Mac Lethal Sucks](https://youtu.be/n2-KlNwcTdk) that has 10 million views. That burn definitely hurt. 😂 It’s clear who won. The self-ironic diss [Im Corny](https://youtu.be/3p6ibNunyN8) on himself is funnier and better than any hater could ever write.

### John D. Boswell (aka Melodysheep)

I discovered the fantastic videos of [Melodysheep](https://www.melodysheep.com/) in 2019 but wasn’t aware till this month that it’s only one person and not a company.

John D. Boswell is a filmmaker, composer, VFX artist, and editor from the pacific northwest.

His skill is incredible, he produced content for National Geographic, Disney, PBS, and many others.

The first video I saw of him was [Timelapse of the Future: A Journey to the End of Time](https://youtu.be/uD4izuDMUQA) which travels from today into the far future to the end of the universe. The video was watched by over 50 million people and is a [musical](https://music.apple.com/artist/melodysheep/555989104) and visual experience in 4K that lasts 30 minutes. Other highly recommended movies are [Timelapse of the Entire Universe](https://youtu.be/TBikbn5XJhg), [Life beyond: Chapter 1. Alien life, deep time, and our place in cosmic history](https://youtu.be/SUelbSa-OkA), [Life Beyond II: The Museum of Alien Life](https://youtu.be/ThDYazipjSI), and [The Secret History of the Moon](https://youtu.be/The Secret History of the Moon).
