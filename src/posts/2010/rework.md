## Change the Way You Work Forever

Today, I recommend a book that I just finished recently and read a second time: _Rework_ by _Jason Fried_ and _David Heinemeier Hansson_.

I have long been a great believer in the philosophy of simplicity which is cultivated by _<del>37signals</del> <ins>Basecamp</ins>_ so successfully. Already their first (free) book [Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real) (also as {% affiliate "paperback version", "0578012812" %}) I read with great interest.

But with _Rework_ they have achieved a true masterpiece. Not without reason, it is a bestseller in the US and the UK. Critics and CEO praise the book in the highest terms (Seth Godin, John Maeda, Chris Anderson, and others).

And unlike the rather simple _Getting Real_, there’s _Rework_ as a hardcover version, in a very attractive binding and with fantastic drawings by Mike Rohde.

The [official website](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) of the book offers a sample excerpt, three funny promotional videos, tons of words of praise and quotes, photos of enthusiastic readers, and a full chapter overview.

Getting Real was specially created for programmers who want to successfully complete a project - _Rework_, on the other hand, is suitable for every employee and employer, from the managing director to the administrator.

With just 21,000 words, the book offers valuable tips for getting a productive and fulfilling working day. Of course, much of this is not new (some points have already been found in _Getting Real_), and none of this has been invented by _<del>37signals</del> <ins>Basecamp</ins>_, but so far I’ve read so many good tips nowhere else in such brevity and conciseness.

And for the very ready lazy people, there is even an {% affiliate "audiobook version", "0307704513" %}.
