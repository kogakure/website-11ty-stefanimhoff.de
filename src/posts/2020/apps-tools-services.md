This is a list of all the tools, apps, and services I use on my iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac. I‚Äôll update this list from time to time.

## Productivity

### Things üì± üñ•

[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is my favorite productivity tool, my task manager. I use it on all devices and it synchronizes instantly via Things Cloud. It‚Äôs available for Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad.

It has won multiple prices, is easy to use, but powerful, has one of the best user experiences on the market.

It follows the GTD approach (_Inbox_, _Today_, _Someday_) and has areas, projects, tasks, and subtasks. Everything can have tags, due dates, start dates, and notes. Projects can be structured with headlines. You can send tasks via email, capture your ideas with a quick entry dialogue, and integrate Apple Calendar. You can also use the [Things URL Scheme](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/) to send commands to Things.

### DEVONthink üì± üñ•

[DEVONthink](https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) is my complementary tool for Things. Things stores everything I have to do, DEVONthink everything I want to remember. I‚Äôve also used [Evernote](https://evernote.com) for many years and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for a year, but both Tools had too many things I didn‚Äôt like.

The company DEVONtechnologies that creates DEVONthink (and a handful of other software products) is just 6 people but provides powerful tools for over a decade. Their tools are used by Attorneys, Journalists, Researchers, or Writers.

DEVONthink fulfills most of my wishes. Your data is your data, it‚Äôs stored on your local hard drive (encrypted or unencrypted). You can store anything in it: Text in various formats, including Markdown. Images, PDF, Videos. You can create folders and use tags, have multiple databases for different topics. It‚Äôs possible to sync your data with most Cloud solutions (Dropbox, iCloud, CloudMe, and WebDAV) or sync between devices via Bonjour. Your data is always encrypted on cloud storage containers. They also have an iOS app: [DEVONthink To Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/devonthink-to-go/id395722470).

DEVONthink has data science algorithms that analyze your content and suggest a location to sort your file into. It has extremely advanced features to analyze, link, sort, and find your content. It has a powerful clipper that allows you to quickly grab the content of any website (converted and cleaned in a lot of formats), add text, video, audio, and screenshots.

I store everything in DEVONthink. Notes, PDF documents (scanned with OCR), images, videos, quotes, and use over 17000 different tags in 5 databases.

### Obsidian üì± üñ•

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write notes and to connect ideas. It‚Äôs the best tool I know for note-taking. In less than 6 month I created over 800 notes in Obsidian. It‚Äôs Markdown based and the files are plain text file on your hard drive. I‚Äôm currently using the [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/) theme.

### Scanner Pro

I use [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/app/scanner-pro-pdf-scanner-app/id333710667) on my iPhone and iPad. Nearly every document I get in a paper format I scan with this app. The documents get converted with [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) to PDF with searchable text and can be automatically saved to cloud storage like Dropbox or iCloud. From there I move the documents directly into DEVONthink.

### Apple Calendar üì± üñ•

[Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/welcome/mac) is the only calendar I use. It looks nice, can be integrated with Exchange servers, Google Calendar, and other calendar providers. My calendars are currently stored in iCloud, but I‚Äôm looking forward to moving them to [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), as soon as the Bridge supports (hopefully) their new encrypted calendar.

### Itsycal üñ•

[Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) is a tiny menu bar calendar that integrates with Apple Calendar. I use it to quickly add or look events without opening the full calendar.

### Alfred üñ•

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is an award-winning app that boosts my productivity immensely. You can integrate the tools with an unbelievable huge amount of other tools and search, filter, move, control **ALL THE THINGS**‚Ñ¢.

I use it to move files to folders on my hard drive, expand snippets, open apps, search on 20+ websites, calculate numbers, look up words in the dictionary, look up contacts, play music, convert colors and units, search DEVONthink, lookup my DNS and IP, emoji codes, generate test data, navigate to GitHub repositories, translate words and sentences, search for software packages, look up movies and TV shows, control my lights, or work with Things. Just to name a few.

There are hundreds of [workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) available.

### Hammerspoon üñ•

[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) is my window manager for many years already. It‚Äôs an open-source tool that allows you to interact with applications, windows, mouse pointers, filesystem, audio devices, batteries, screens, keyboard/mouse events, clipboards, wifi, and more. I just use it to launch apps, move them to my preferred screen, and navigate between apps.

To get a basic workflow you can just copy [my settings](https://github.com/kogakure/dotfiles/tree/master/hammerspoon/hammerspoon.symlink) and modify them. If you want crazier automation, you‚Äôll need some [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) knowledge to code it yourself.

### Apple Numbers üì± üñ•

I use [Apple Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) for everything I need to do with spreadsheets. Calculating and tracking my income, my stocks, yearly expenses, salary increases, etc. I usually store all spreadsheets in DEVONthink and just open it from there in Numbers. This way it‚Äôs encrypted and synchronized.

### JustFocus üñ•

[JustFocus](https://climstudio.com/justfocus/) is a nice, free tool to make sure you work focused and do regular breaks. It uses the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to switch between work and break time. You can adjust the length of work, short or long break periods. During break time the tool will block your screen and show a nice wallpaper and a quote to make sure you spend your break away from the screen.

### Bartender üñ•

[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) allows organizing the menu bar icons on Mac. You can rearrange icons, hide them, or just show them for a short time when they update. It‚Äôs really helpful to see only what‚Äôs relevant at any given time on the menu bar.

### Time Sink üñ•

[Time Sink](https://manytricks.com/timesink/) is a Mac app that allows tracking how much time you spend on which app. You can see which apps are active and how long and at what times.

### Habit Tracker

I use [Habit Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/app/habit-tracker/id1438388363) to track my habits. You can decide which habit you want to perform how often per day or week and then check off what you did during the day. You can see your streaks for each habit and stay motivated.

### IFTTT (Pro) üì± üåê

I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) (If This Then That) to automate a bunch of tasks across multiple services and tools on the internet or at home. There are hundreds of services and home appliances that can be connected.

You can create powerful workflows to handover of data between two of these services without programming: Automatically publish a new blog post to Twitter, save a new Instagram photo to Dropbox, save liked videos or tweets to Pocket, record your weight into a spreadsheet, send out an email when you enter or leave a specific geographical area, just to name a few.

I use around 20 services of that long list.

### Apple Workflow üì±

[Workflow](https://www.workflow.is/) is another automation tool, this time just for iOS. Apple bought the company and integrated the tool into its ecosystem. There are much fewer services in Apple Workflow than in IFTTT, but it allows much more complicated workflows (not just data handover between two services). You can automate a lot of apps on your device depending on time, location, arrival, leaving, WLAN, BlueTooth, NFC, or opening an app. And also build complex interfaces taking user input and doing something with it. But you don‚Äôt need to learn to program, it‚Äôs mostly drag and drop.

## Design, Photography & Conception

### iA Writer üì± üñ•

My main tool for writing is [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). I use it on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. It‚Äôs the most minimalistic, distraction-free, most beautiful writing experience. It supports Markdown, has tools to analyze your words, count reading time, characters, words, and sentences. I write most of my text in Markdown and either open it from DEVONthink in iA Writer or save my texts in iCloud and index the contents of these folders in DEVONthink.

### Affinity Designer üì± üñ•

The British company **Serif** creates the best design tools I know. I also worked with and owned Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for over 15 years and also use Sketch at work. But [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/) is just my tool of choice for everything I design: Websites, UI, Flyer, Logos, etc.

I switched away from Adobe when they started forcing people to their cloud solutions and making it impossible to just buy a new version every few years but instead have to pay monthly ‚Äúrent‚Äù. Serif won multiple awards for Affinity Designer.

I also use the iPad version and soon plan to buy a big iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil to create even cooler things with Affinity Designer.

### Affinity Photo üì± üñ•

[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/de/photo/) is the second tool from **Serif**. I use it less often, but whenever I want to work on photos or photo manipulations I use Affinity Photo. Serif won multiple awards for Affinity Photo.

It has support for RAW, PSD, 360¬∞ photo editing, HDR, batch automation, smart objects, montage. I‚Äôm by all means, not a professional photographer, but it‚Äôs made for them.

### Affinity Publisher üñ•

[Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/publisher/) is the newest tool by **Serif**. It‚Äôs an incredibly powerful DTP tool to replace Adobe InDesign or Quark Express. I just started working with it but I plan to create and layout a book with it. It seamlessly integrates with Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo and allows doing nearly everything you can think of.

### MindNode üì± üñ•

[MindNode](https://mindnode.com/) is my favorite tool to create mind notes and map out ideas. I use it on all my devices. When I learned everything about Japanese Design I used it to [map out my research](https://my.mindnode.com/FGhdh66uMbi1aJ9RfriKUL3JoMCHd18aS8z9Uayw).

### Typeface üñ•

[Typeface](https://typefaceapp.com/) is my favorite font app. It‚Äôs simple and beautiful, the price is fair and it does all I need.

### Blender üñ•

I don‚Äôt use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) very often, because it‚Äôs just an incredibly complex open-source 3D creation software. I used to work a lot with 3D in my first job (3ds max, Maya, and Cinema 4D) but when I moved to the web I stopped working with 3D software regularly. But I still love it and I‚Äôm currently doing online training to learn Blender properly.

### Bƒìhance üì± üåê

[Bƒìhance](https://www.behance.net/) is the second platform I regularly browse for inspiration. The portfolios of artists and designers are of very high quality and it‚Äôs possible to remember interesting pieces on boards. You can also follow your favorite artists.

### Instagram üì± üåê

I don‚Äôt like [Instagram](https://www.behance.net/) too much, because the browsing experience is crappy and you can only use it on the phone. No iPad app, only a limited web app. But it‚Äôs still a nice app to publish some photos from time to time and follow friends and family. I use it now exclusivly on the web.

## Development

### NeoVim üñ•

I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) as my primary code editor. It‚Äôs just the best editor available. You can see my configuration files, the mappings, settings, functions, and the plugins I use in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kogakure/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim) repository.

### Visual Studio Code üñ•

I still use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from time to time. I use a bunch of extensions which would be too much to list them all.

### Kitty üñ•

I used iTerm2 for a long time as my terminal, but recently I switched to [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty). It is much fast which is important, because I use NeoVim in the terminal as my primary code editor.

I use additionally [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/) and [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to manage and restore multiple terminal sessions. I can easily switch between projects or keep multiple servers running.

### GitHub üì± üñ• üåê

[GitHub](https://github.com/) (or [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise) at my workplace) is my tool for storing and working with source code. All my websites are on GitHub and also a few dozen other projects. I use [GitHub for mobile](https://github.com/mobile/) and sometimes [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). But usually, I use Git on the command line.

### Netlify üåê

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is my favorite hosting service. All my websites are hosted for free. If I push a new feature to GitHub Netlify will [automatically deploy](https://app.netlify.com/sites/stefanimhoff-de/deploys) my website on a preview URL. After all the tests have been running successfully and I merge the feature the new feature goes live without needing to do anything more.

### Dash üì± üñ•

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is an API documentation browser. You can browse over 200 API documentation without searching on the internet. Dash downloads the latest documentation offline to your computer and makes it possible to even look things up when you have no connection to the internet. And I also use an integration in Alfred.

### Kaleidoscope üñ•

I used [Kaleidoscope](https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) as my default tool for merge conflict in Git, but Visual Studio Code has a much nicer way of fixing merge conflicts, I use Kaleidoscope mostly to compare complete codebases or the differences in images. I think it‚Äôs currently way too expensive and I‚Äôm sure I bought it for much less.

### Image Shrinker üñ•

[Image Shrinker](https://image-shrinker.com/) is a nice, free tool to minify images and graphics with just one drop. Easy, fast, and useful.

### Integrity üñ•

I use [Integrity](https://apps.apple.com/app/integrity/id513610341) regularly to check all my websites for broken links. It‚Äôs not something I do every month but when I do it, this tool is really helpful.

## News & Information

### Feedbin üì± üåê

[Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) is my main source of information. I follow all my RSS/Atom feeds, my YouTube subscriptions, Twitter tweets, Newsletters, Reddit, and news sources. A really cool feature of Feedbin is to track changes in articles.

I save everything of interest into Raindrop.io for later research. I used Feedly for many years since the Google News Reader shut down, but recently the pricing and features did not match and Feedbin is much more fun to use.

### Reeder üì± üñ•

I use Feedbin together with [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/). Reeder is a beautiful news reader which allows using read later services (Pocket, Instapaper) and many different services (Feedbin, Feedly, etc.) and also directly reading RSS/Atom feeds without a service and synchronizing them between all devices via iCloud.

### Raindrop.io (Pro) üì± üñ• üåê

[Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) is my bookmark manager. It is so much fun, I save nearly everything in it. The tool allows organizing bookmarks in collections (\$), tagging and filtering (by type of bookmark).

A deduplicating service finds broken links (\$). The new highlighting feature allows to use 4 different colors and add comments to any text. A browser extension allows to highlight the text also directly on the website. Each collection can use a different view (Grid, Headlines, Masonry, or List). Full-text search will search every web-page and PDF (\$). Raindrop automatically creates a backup of every website for offline reading (\$).

Raindrop can also be used to create moodboards and it is possible to upload common media files. Collections can be edited together with other users and it is possible to share individual collections publicly ([here are mine](https://raindrop.io/kogakure)).

### Pocket (Premium)

I still use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) to create highlights, that get then synchronized to Readwise. As soon as the highlights of Raindrop.io are synchronized to Readwise, I will reconsider keeping Pocket. I automatically move articles from Raindrop.io to Pocket via IFTTT.

### Readwise üì± üåê

[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) is my favorite tool to have all my highlights of different services in one place, no matter if it is my Kindle, Apple Books, Pocket, Feedly, Instapaper, Medium, Twitter, etc. Each morning you get five random highlights to review which is a fantastic way to be reminded of ideas you highlighted.

I synchronize my highlights with Obsidian where I store them permanently as Markdown documents.

### Pinboard üåê

[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) I use mostly as a backup for all the links I save. They get automatically transferred from Raindrop.io to Pinboard with IFTTT. I joined Pinboard when the price was a one-time payment of 9 USD.

### Wikipedia üì± üåê

I use the [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) website and [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id324715238) all the time. The app allows saving interesting articles into collections and synchronizing them across mobile devices.

### Tweetbot üì± üñ•

I read Twitter feeds in Feedbin, but occasionally I use [Tweetbot for iOS](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) and [Tweetbot for Mac](https://www.tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) as a Twitter client. The Twitter feed is otherwise just too messy, unordered, and full of advertising. I don‚Äôt like Twitter in particular, but unfortunately, a lot of industry news is just published there. I mute everybody annoying instantly in Tweetbot, sometimes for a week, a month, or forever.

### Minds üì± üåê

After Twitter started censoring and de-platforming people I started using [Minds](https://www.minds.com/) again. I used it in 2018 but stopped using it. But in the meantime it got so much nice new features, it can easily replace Facebook and Twitter. It‚Äôs for free speech and the people on Minds really dislike if somebody reports what somebody elses posted, just because they think it‚Äôs offensive. Only criminal things (doxing, calls to violence, etc.) will be removed. If you don‚Äôt like somebody, just block them. I post recommendations on [my profile](https://www.minds.com/kogakure/).

### Mastodon üì± üåê

I wish more people would use [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) because it‚Äôs much nicer, friendlier, and _decentralised_. Nobody owns it, nobody can control it or cash it and nobody can silence people. There are hundreds of instances talking to each other.

Currently, I‚Äôm using [Tootle for Mastodon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootle-for-mastodon/id1236013466) on iOS and mirror my Twitter tweets via a [bridge](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/). If you want to follow me: [@kogakure@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@kogakure).

## Communication

### Slack üì± üñ•

I use [Slack](https://slack.com/) mostly at work. I also have my account but use it just to push deploy messages, Git commits, Twitter feeds, or RSS updates to my websites in my channels. But I like the tool and I‚Äôm the administrator of a workspace with over 800 people.ü§ò

### Apple Messages üì± üñ•

[Messages](https://support.apple.com/explore/messages) is the messenger I use with my family. We all have Apple devices and even my grandmother can use the app. The app has also some nice features. I wish the Desktop app would get more love by Apple.

### Apple FaceTime üì± üñ•

[FaceTime](https://apps.apple.com/app/facetime/id1110145091) is the video chat messenger I use with my family.

### ProtonMail (Plus) üì± üåê

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is my main email provider, end-to-end encrypted emails. I stopped using Gmail as my main email provider 3 years ago. I sometimes use the [web app](https://mail.protonmail.com/) or the [new beta version](https://beta.protonmail.com/) of the web app which looks nice.

### Apple Mail üñ•

I use Apple Mail on Desktop to connect to my work email on an Exchange server and my ProtonMail server via the [ProtonMail Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/).

### Signal üì± üñ•

[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is a messenger I use just with co-workers and friends. It the messenger with the most security and privacy. Additionally, it‚Äôs open source, and no malicious code can be sneaked into it by some government or privat entity. After deleting WhatsApp it‚Äôs my favorite messenger to communicate across different platforms.

### Telegram üì± üñ•

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is a messenger I use just with co-workers and friends. A nice thing is your profile can have a link you share with unknown people to contact you. It the messenger with the nicest features. You can edit a send text and fix errors, create public or private chat rooms and encrypt your communication (unfortunately not the default setting, so people don‚Äôt do it often).

You can use encrypted Git repositories and link and validate your [profile](https://keybase.io/kogakure) with a bunch of external services. You can send messages that auto-delete and even send messages to users not yet on Keybase.

### Element üì± üñ• üåê

[Element](https://element.io/) is the official messenger of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). It‚Äôs an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

It has grown over the last years and I hope it will win the messenger wars one day. With corporations trying to control the ecosystem or governments to weaken encryption, free internet and free communication must move to a decentralized messenger. The messenger is as powerful and feature-rich as Slack, but completely free.

A lot of big companies (as a recent example Mozilla) move their communication to a self-hosted instance of Matrix. The French governement, German military, and a lot of Germanies universities use it. Every instance can communicate with all other instances.

Matrix even allows bridges, to communicate with a user of Slack, Apple Messenger, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, or similar. The bridges are still early development but the future for Matrix looks good.

You can contact me on [@kogakure:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@kogakure:matrix.org).

### Status üì± üñ•

[Status](https://status.im/) is a new completely decentralized instant messaging app. It‚Äôs also a crypto wallet and a Web3 browser. No phone, email, or username is needed to use it. You can choose a random unique id at the first start. I think it‚Äôs a very pretty messenger and it‚Äôs easy to share the own (complete anonymous) [profile](https://join.status.im/u/0x046ef708e10d74f71a3294f6bb4b96f0731c6a39bd9abd0993ddfd0015500d3c0dda98b351b2685b9f0e0e57d71cba8149d494f801956a051e77d15d963dc74b81).

### Session üì± üñ•

[Session](https://getsession.org/) is a new decentralized messenger with an interesting security model. It collects no meta data. Not even your phone number or email. You are completely anonymous. The first time you use it you get a session key. You can save a backup for this session to restore it on another device. To contact another person all you need is have the public session key. The chat is routed through a onion routing network which makes it nearly impossible to leave any footprint. It‚Äôs open source and censorship resitant.

### Brave Talk üåê

[Brave Talk](https://talk.brave.com/) is a way to have unlimited video calls with up to 4 people for free. No download of any app needed.

### Jitsi Meet üì± üåê

Another nice open-source tool for video chat is [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/). It supports a lot of users (currently 75) at the same time. To create a room is as easy as to click a button. No extra software needed, it runs in the browser. There are also mobile versions available. It‚Äôs also the default video conferencing system of [Riot](https://jitsi.riot.im/) (Elements).

## Browser

### Brave Browser üì± üñ•

My primary browser is [Brave](https://brave.com/). It has the same engine as Chrome, but ad-blocking and tracker-blocking are included by default. It blocks fingerprinting, a way to track you across the internet. Brave is eager to implement new features, for example crypto wallets or the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) peer-to-peer protocol. Plus: It supports all Chrome extensions.

### Firefox (Developer Edition) üì± üñ•

My secondary browser is [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/). I simply love the features of Firefox. The developer experience is fantastic and I like in particular the bookmarking system (this sucks with other browsers). Firefox supports tags and has a nice bookmark bar to quickly filter and search bookmarks.

Also, Mozilla has privacy as a much higher priority than Google. Google works actively on ways to prevent ad-blocking while Mozilla blocks trackers by default and also allows and provides all kinds of additional privacy tools (like container tabs). I also use [Firefox Mobile](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/mobile/) as my browser on mobile.

## Media

### Apple Music üì± üñ•

I use [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) as my only music streaming service. I stream music to my five Sonos boxes around my home and use it to wake me up, do workouts or relax on the sofa. I used Spotify before, but they started de-platforming podcasts, they don‚Äôt agree with and I don‚Äôt support this behavior.

### Apple Podcast üì± üñ•

To listen to podcasts I use [Apple Podcasts](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029). I like how it‚Äôs integrated with all my devices.

### Sonos üì± üñ•

[Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/) is my favorite sound system since 2012. I have two [Play:5](https://www.sonos.com/shop/play5-white.html), one Play:3, one [Play:1](https://www.sonos.com/shop/one.html) and the [Playbar](https://www.sonos.com/shop/playbar.html). It‚Äôs super cool to sync all boxes around the home and have no lag between the music in different rooms.

### YouTube üì± üåê

I use the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) app and website a lot to watch videos from channels I follow. I use the extensions [DF YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/) and [Enhancer for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/) to make the viewing experience more enjoyable. I hide all sidebars, comments, suggestions, and other needy crap. Also, all videos stop by default and are automatically switched to fullscreen mode.

### Odysee/LBRY üì± üñ• üåê

[Odysee](https://odysee.com/) is a complete decentralized video platform that doesn‚Äôt censor anything except illegal things. It uses the [LBRY](https://lbry.com/) network for open, free, and fair digital content. LBRY itself doesn‚Äôt censor anything, it is not able to do so, because the content is shared peer-to-peer and the meta data lives on the blockchain.

### IMDb üì± üåê

[IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) is one of the more often used apps on my devices. I look up actors, directors, movies, TV shows all the time. I also log all my watched TV shows and movies to keep track of what I already watched.

### TMDb üåê

[TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is a nice collaborative movie database and I started using it to link to movies on my website because I like to support open projects.

### WerStreamtEs üì± üåê

[WerStreamt.es](https://www.werstreamt.es/) (German for WhoStreams.it) is my favorite platform to keep track of movies and TV shows. You can put movies and TV shows on a watchlist and add the streaming services you have. The app will send out emails with reminders if something on your watchlist has a new season or is available for streaming.

### Netflix üì± üì∫

I use [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) mostly on my Apple TV and sometimes on my iPad. I stopped watching _real_ TV seven years ago and just watch movies and TV shows mostly on Netflix. Here is a [list of things I watched on Netflix](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls027045180/).

### Prime Video üì± üì∫

The second streaming service I use is [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/). It has much fewer good movies and TV shows, but it‚Äôs also much, much cheaper. Her is a [list of things I watched on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls027045359/).

### Apple Photos üì± üñ•

[Apple Photos](https://www.apple.com/ios/photos/) is the default app Apple comes with. It‚Äôs good enough for me and easy enough to use by all generations of the whole family. This is where we share photos in the family.

### QuickTime Player üñ•

[QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime) is a nice player and it‚Äôs the default on a Mac. Not much more to say. I also quickly record screencasts with it. It‚Äôs quicker and easier than recording with apps like _ScreenFlow_.

### VLC üì± üñ•

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) is a really good and free player. It can play **anything**. Even corrupt or partial videos. I also use it to stream my videos from my [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/).

### Shazam üì±

I use [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/) only for one case: To recognize songs and find them on Spotify.

## Security & Privacy

### Bitwarden üì± üñ•

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is my Password Manager. I switched recently from 1Password, because for a Password Manager security and trust is more important than design. The source code of Bitwarden is open, no possibility for backdoors. Bitwarden is free with basic features and adding the premium features is much cheaper than with other Password Managers.

### ExpressVPN üì± üñ•

[ExpressVPN](https://www.expressrefer.com/refer-friend?locale=de&referrer_id=65477408&utm_campaign=referrals&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=referral_dashboard) is my current VPN provider. I switched to it from NordVPN after my 3-year contract was over.

### Cryptomator üì± üñ•

[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) is a free tool to encrypt cloud data. I encrypt all private data either in DEVONthink or with Cryptomator storages in Dropbox.

### AdGuard Pro üì±

[AdGuard](https://adguard.com/) is a good way of blocking advertising on iOS devices. I use it to block advertising system-wide on my iPhone and iPad.

## Learning

### Duolingo (Plus) üì± üåê

I love [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)! I learn on Duolingo without missing one day for more than 2 years now. It‚Äôs an intuitive and fun way of learning. And it‚Äôs free! I started switching to **Plus** recently which removes advertising, adds offline support and streak repair. I learn [Japanese](https://www.duolingo.com/enroll/ja/en/Learn-Japanese) and [Spanish](https://www.duolingo.com/enroll/es/en/Learn-Spanish) every day. They also have really good [Podcasts](https://podcast.duolingo.com/) for Spanish and French, [Stories](https://stories.duolingo.com/), Progress Quiz, Leagues, and much more.

### Drops üì±

[Drops](https://languagedrops.com/) is a fun app I started using a few months ago. I use it for learning vocabulary as a companion to Duolingo. You can learn for 5 minutes for free every 8 hours which is around 10 minutes every day.

### Shirabe Jisho üì± üåê

Shirabe Jisho is a [powerful Japanese-English dictionary](https://jisho.org/). It shows nearly everything you can wish for, even visual stroke order of the characters. The [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/shirabe-jisho/id1005203380) is a complete offline dictionary.

### Japanese üì±

[Japanese](https://japaneseapp.com/) is another really beautiful Japanese dictionary for iOS and Android. You can even use Flashcards and tests your knowledge about Kanji.

### Human Japanese üì±

[Human Japanese](https://humanjapanese.com/) is a paid app to learn Japanese. The interface is a little bit dated, but the content is really good.

### Goodreads üì± üåê

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) is the only decent social reading platform. I use it to track the books I want to read and the books I‚Äôm reading and update my status once a week. You can save books to shelves, follow friends, and get inspirations about what to read next or do a reading challenge every year. You can [follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28460819) or look into the books I‚Äôve read.

### Literal üì± üåê

[Literal](https://literal.club/) is a new platform to explore new books, join book clubs and share what you read with other people. It‚Äôs currently still invite-only, but I have invites left. Ping me if you want an invite. You can [follow me on Literal](https://literal.club/kogakure).

### Kindle üì± üñ•

I use the [iPad and iPhone Kindle](https://apps.apple.com/app/kindle/id302584613) app and the [MacOS Kindle](https://apps.apple.com/app/kindle/id405399194) app as a companion to my Kindle Paperwhite. I use the app usually either to look at color photos or illustrations or after I‚Äôve finished a book to review my marginalia (notes and markings).

## Health & Fitness

### Health üì±

I like the [Health](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/) app of Apple, the only drawback is that there is not an iPad or Desktop version of it. It gets better with every release and aggregates data from all kinds of other apps and services. I get my Meditation times, movement data and workouts from my [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/), audio data from my [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/), my weight from my [Withings Body Cardio](https://www.withings.com/body-cardio) scale, and my sleep from my [Fitbit Charge](https://www.fitbit.com/charge4) ‚Äì though this needs an extra app to get the data over an API, as Fitbit and Apple have a vendetta and Fitbit doesn‚Äôt give their data to the health app.

### Activity üì±

The [Activity](https://apps.apple.com/app/activity/id1208224953) app is the app delivered with an Apple Watch. It‚Äôs nice to track workouts, movement, and changes in your activity over time. It also allows competing with family and friends. And the data is transferred to the Health app.

### Health Mate üì± üåê

The [Health Mate](https://healthmate.withings.com/) app by Withings is a nice way to have an insight into my weight, fat, water, muscle mass, heart frequency, and pulse wave velocity every morning. I use the Withings [Body Cardio](https://www.withings.com/body-cardio) scale, the [Sleep Analyzer](https://www.withings.com/sleep-analyzer), the [BPM Connect](https://www.withings.com/bpm-connect) blood pressure monitor, and [Thermo](https://www.withings.com/thermo).

### Reps & Sets

I use the [Reps & Sets](https://repsandsetsapp.com/) app for my [Calisthenics](/calisthenics/) training, multiple times per week. As a early adopter I get the Premium features for free.

### Insight Timer üì±

I use [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) for my daily meditation. I honestly don‚Äôt use much of it‚Äôs features, except the feature to create custom timers.

## Finance & Calculations

### iFinance üì± üñ•

[iFinance](https://www.syniumsoftware.com/ifinance) is my tool to track income and spending. Every day I track my expenses and income for ~5 minutes and make sure everything is fine with my accounts. iFinance has nice tools to automate and analyze your expenses to find out how you spend your income.

I also use the iOS or Apple Watch version to track expenses while I‚Äôm on the way. The data is synchronized with iCloud or WiFi across devices.

### Stocks üì± üñ•

I use the Apple [Stocks](https://apps.apple.com/app/stocks/id1069512882) app to keep track of my stocks and funds. It‚Äôs simple and easy to use and available on iOS and macOS.

### Calcbot üì±

[Calcbot](https://www.tapbots.com/calcbot/) is a beautifully designed calculator and unit converter I use already for a lot of years. It‚Äôs also available for the Apple Watch and has nice features as sending your calculations as an email, syncing across devices with iCloud, and much more.

## Weather

### Netatmo üì± üåê

I use the [Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com/) weather app to monitor the temperature, CO‚ÇÇ, humidity, noise level, and air pressure in all my rooms and also on the balcony. I also use a rain monitor. The devices are beautifully designed and have a very long life-duration (I use them since 2013).

### Weather Pro üì±

[WeatherPro](http://www.weatherpro.eu/) is the best and most accurate weather app I know. It‚Äôs a free app but for 9,99 ‚Ç¨ per year, you can get more detailed data, hourly forecasts, and some other nice features. Also, all advertising gets removed from apps by _MeteoGroup_.

### RainToday üì±

[RainToday](http://raintoday.weatherpro.de/lang/en.html) is the second app from _MeteoGroup_ on my devices. It gives live updates on upcoming rain on your location and shows the estimated duration, intensity, and direction of the rain.

### AlertsPro üì±

[AlertsPro](http://www.alertspro.com/lang/en.html) is the thirds weather app by _MeteoGroup_ on my devices. It shows weather warnings for your locations and visualizes the length, region, and severity of severe weather.

### SolarWatch üì±

[SolarWatch](https://apps.apple.com/app/solarwatch-tageslicht-wetter/id1191365122) is my favorite app to show the sunrise and sunset.

## Tools

### Hue üì± üñ•

I use the [Philips Hue](https://apps.apple.com/app/philips-hue/id1055281310) app to control the light in my home. Nearly all of my light bulbs are now from Hue and I automate a lot of my light cycles. I turn on light automatically on when the dusk starts and wake me up with lights during wintertime. I also dim down my lights every day at the same time and shut them off at the same time. As I always follow the same routine this works quite nicely. I also use multiple different switches and Siri to control the light around my home manually. I even use an [Alfred workflow](https://github.com/benknight/hue-alfred-workflow) to control my light directly from the computer.

### Apple Maps üì± üñ•

I switched to [Apple Maps](https://www.apple.com/maps/), because I dislike Google since a while. But sometimes I switch and use[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), because the information for stores and opening times is still much better.

### Google Translate üì± üåê

[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) is my favorite translation app. It got so good in the last years that most sentences it produces don‚Äôt need any manual changes.

### Dropbox (Plus) üì± üñ• üåê

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is my cloud provider. My [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/) synchronizes automatically everything in Dropbox as a backup. Never trust cloud providers.

### iCloud üì± üñ• üåê

[iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) is my second cloud provider. The new CloudKit sync is so fast and seamless with Apple Devices and Apple services work optimally with iCloud.

### The Unarchiver üñ•

[The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) is just the best, free, and the only app you need to unpack nearly every format available.

### DaisyDisk üñ•

I use [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/) to find and delete unneeded files from my computer. It‚Äôs the best visual representation of your hard drive I know. Files can be easily collected and delete with one click.

### AppCleaner üñ•

[AppClearner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) is a nice and free application that allows uninstalling unwanted apps and delete all traces and left-over settings at the same time.

### Find My üì± üñ•

I use the [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) app to find my devices ‚Ä¶ and my family. And also to get random calls by my grandmother why I‚Äôm at home and not at work. üòÜ

### Komoot üì± üåê

If you‚Äôre into Biking or Hiking [Komoot](https://www.komoot.de/) is the best app I know. It‚Äôs free, but possible to buy better Hiking maps for regions or the whole world. It allows for creating tours and send them to the iPhone or even Apple Watch app and navigate with it. The route gets even broken down into different kinds of streets, height profile, and difficulty. And of course, you can also record your tours and share them.

### Citymapper üì± üåê

[Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) is a fantastic routing app available for selected big cities around the globe. My home city Hamburg is included. It knows all available transport options and times and calculates the best tour to your target. It even shows you when to get on and off transports and on which side of a subway you have entered.

### DB Navigator üì±

[DB Navigator](https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/mobile/db-navigator.shtml) is the app of the **Deutsche Bahn** (Geman Train). It got better over the last years and allows today to not only book tickets but also see all data and trains in real-time. The information is much more accurate than asking a conductor on the platform if a train is late again (which happens a lot in Germany). Germans are known for being always on time, but not our trains ‚Ä¶

### DHL Paket üì±

The [DHL Paket](https://www.dhl.de/de/privatkunden/kampagnenseiten/dhl-app.html) app is the best way to see all packages on the way to your home or somebody from your home.
