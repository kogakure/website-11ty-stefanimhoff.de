I write a lot. Not just essays, but also notes, poetry, books, technical documentation, discussions, and proposals at work. Most of the things I write are in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) because it’s one of the quickest and best Markup languages that exists.

You don’t need any tools besides a simple text editor to write Markdown, but it helps to have a nice Markdown writing app. For me, this app is [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) since the day it was released. I like its simplicity, minimalism, and its powerful writing tools (focus, syntax, or style modes).

iA Writer supports [preview templates](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates) and besides the included templates they offer [additional templates](https://ia.net/downloads#templates). When you write on one side of the app your Markdown, you can see it presented in a nice formatted form on the other side.

Recently, I finished the book [Engaging Japanese Philosophy: A Short History](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0824869796?ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0824869796) which was set in beautiful typography.

On a Sunday morning, I decided to create a [prototype](https://codepen.io/kogakure/pen/RwxwoWm) based on the typesetting of this book in CSS. It had some interesting challenges and I did it just for fun.

## iA Writer Template Nanzan

Later that week I decided to create my first iA Writer template based on that style. I called the template [Nanzan](https://github.com/kogakure/ia-writer-template-nanzan) (南山) because the book was typeset by the _Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture_. It’s free and you can download the code as a ZIP archive and double click the `.iatemplate` file.

## iA Writer Template Shibui

After I finished my first template I decided to immediately create my second template, based on the aesthetics style I used for my personal branding. I called it [Shibui](https://github.com/kogakure/ia-writer-template-shibui) (渋い) because that is the style I based my design on.

Both templates come with a light and dark design and I’ll improve them probably over time. To check up on changes, feel free to watch the GitHub repositories. If you find any issues, please open an issue on the corresponding repository.
