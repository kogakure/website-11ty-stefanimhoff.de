Peter Thiel named the enemy of Bitcoin at the Bitcoin conference 2022: It’s the oligarchic rule of the old people. They use hate factories like ESG to rail up hate against Bitcoin, because their fiat money system is beginning to fail.

ESG is basically a bullshit category they made up to classify enemies and to make sure their woke ideology is infiltrating companies around the world.

> (…) the real enemy is ESG. (…) It’s always sort of unclear what it means, you know, you might think of it as not charitable for me to name some enemies here, but I think that ESG is just a hate factory. It’s a factory for naming enemies and we should not be allowing them to do that.
>
> Or that, of course, you can sort of always ask the question: <q>What’s the difference between ESG and CCP, the Chinese Communist Party</q>?
>
> They are into social and governance. Environmental is sort of fake, it’s probably also fake in a lot of these cases, but I always think when you think ESG you should be thinking CCP.
>
> (…) ESG has been surprisingly inclusive, basically as far as I can tell, the only things that are sort of not liked are some of the carbon industries and then Bitcoin. It’s because the other companies, they are subject to political control, especially when your companies go public.
>
> I always advise CEOs when they take their companies public, there’s some good things: You get liquidity, the early investors can cash out, and you can get some credibility. But it’s basically, taking a company public it’s a de facto government takeover where some people, who are effectively government bureaucrats became more empowered. It’s the CFO, the General Counsel, the accountants, the lawyers, the HR people, all these sort of extensions of the state are given more power, and we have to think of ESG as sort of this vast umbrella thing.
>
> One of the great features of Bitcoin—it’s always a question whether it’s a bug or a feature, but I would submit that in the sort of more heavy-handed status of the world, it is far more of a feature than a bug—is that Bitcoin is not a company. It does not have a board, we do not know who Satoshi is.
>
> And in some ways all these things seemed extreme in the world of the 2010s where the inflation was low, the regulations were not the worst, it seems extremely prescient for the world of the 2020s.
>
> If we had to summarize this in one frame, it is the finance gerontocracy [oligarchical rule of old leaders] that runs the country through whatever silly virtue signaling/hate factory term like ESG they have versus what I would call, what we have to think of as a revolutionary youth movement.
>
> And we have to just go out from this conference and take over the world.
